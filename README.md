# Abstract Server

This projects aims to make easier server/client communication in java. \
This is done by abstracting the connection and socket part.
## All you need to do
You just need to have a class that implements ClientObserver and one that implements \
ServerObserver. You then run Threads with an object Server and an object Client.\
This should start the server client communication.\
An example is given in the examples file.

## What must still be done
- Test units 
- Maybe better comments
- Maybe better read me
- Add new functionalities to abstract
